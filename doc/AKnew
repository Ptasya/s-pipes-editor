2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:
In SPEd rights of different suer groups are assigned manualy by administrator. Here are described default settings, which will be applied if administrator has not created ay rule for users and rights.
There are three user roles defines:
• Unauthorized
Any user that did not log in has permissions to create new pipelines, edit and execute them, but has no read/write access to the ontology storage and therefore can not save or load pipelines.
• Authorized
Logged in users can see, modify and create pipelines as well as save andload them.
• Administrators
Users of this group have the same permisions as authorized users, and in addition they can edit other users rights.

Authorization capabilities are enabled by Spring Security on the backend. From the UI standpoint the difference is the following:
• There are no Save/Load features shown to an unauthorized user
• The link for unauthorization is shown to an authorized user
• The link to admin panel is shown to administrators
